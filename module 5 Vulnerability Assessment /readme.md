Module 05 — Vulnerability Assessment (CEH v13)
Objective

Equip learners with the knowledge and practical skills to identify, validate, prioritise, and report security vulnerabilities across systems, networks, and applications using automated scanners and manual verification techniques.

Description

Vulnerability Assessment (VA) is a systematic process to discover, classify, and prioritise security weaknesses in an environment before adversaries can exploit them. This module covers VA methodologies, how to select and configure scanning tools, how to validate and reduce false positives, risk rating, and how to produce clear, actionable reports for remediation. Emphasis is placed on ethical practice, scoping, and minimizing impact to production systems.

Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, learners will be able to:

Explain the VA lifecycle: scoping → discovery → scanning → validation → reporting → remediation tracking.

Differentiate vulnerability assessment from penetration testing and threat modeling.

Choose appropriate scanning tools and configure them for safe, effective assessments.

Interpret scanner output, validate findings manually, and reduce false positives.

Classify and prioritise vulnerabilities using risk metrics (CVSS, business impact).

Produce professional vulnerability assessment reports with remediation guidance.

Understand legal/ethical constraints and coordinate with stakeholders (change windows, approvals).

Techniques Covered

Asset discovery and inventorying before scanning.

Credentialed vs non-credentialed scanning and the trade-offs of each.

Automated scanning (network, host, web app) and tuning for scope/performance.

Manual verification of high-impact findings (exploit proof-of-concept without exploitation).

Correlating results across tools to build an accurate risk picture.

Risk scoring and prioritisation using CVSS and contextual business impact.

Patch verification and re-scanning to confirm remediation.

Handling sensitive outputs: secrets, PII, credentials.

Common Tools
Purpose	Tools / Examples
Network & host scanning	Nessus, OpenVAS/Greenbone, Qualys, Nmap
Web application scanning	Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nikto, 
Credentialed assessment	Agents, WinRM/SSH access, authenticated scanner sessions
Result aggregation & reporting	Dradis, Faraday, spreadsheets, ticketing systems
Example Lab Tasks (step-by-step)

Scope & Asset Inventory

Build a target list (IP ranges, hosts, web apps) and obtain authorization.

Recon & Discovery

Use Nmap/Masscan to confirm live hosts and open ports.

Configure Scanner

Set up Nessus/OpenVAS: policies, safe checks, credentialed scans for hosts.

Run Non-intrusive Scan

Execute a non-intrusive scan during a test window; collect raw outputs.

Run Credentialed Scan (if authorized)

Provide valid credentials to obtain deeper configuration vulnerabilities.

Web App Scan

Use Burp Suite or ZAP for authenticated web app scanning; validate findings manually.

Validate Findings

Manually verify high-risk items to reduce false positives (do not exploit beyond proof).

Prioritise & Score

Assign CVSS scores and contextual business impact to each finding.

Report & Remediate

Produce a vulnerability report (summary, technical detail, remediation steps).

Re-scan

After fixes, re-scan to ensure vulnerabilities are resolved.

Deliverables

VA Report (PDF / Markdown) — Executive summary, technical findings, CVSS & business risk, remediation roadmap, timelines.

Raw Scan Files — .nessus, .xml, .xml/.nmap outputs for auditability.

Commands & Configs — Scanner policies, credentials used for authenticated scans (stored securely).

Evidence Folder — Screenshots, validated proof-of-concept (non-destructive).

Remediation Tracker — CSV or ticket links tracking fixes, owners, and status.

Risk Rating & Prioritisation Guidance

Use CVSS base score + temporal/environmental context to prioritise.

Prioritise findings that expose credentials, remote code execution, privilege escalation, or breach of sensitive data.

Include business-impact tags (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and suggested SLA for remediation.

Countermeasures & Remediation Examples

Apply vendor patches and security updates.

Remove or restrict unnecessary services and open ports.

Harden configurations (secure TLS, disable legacy protocols).

Enforce least privilege; rotate and secure credentials.

Implement automated patch management and continuous scanning.

Use WAFs and IPS where appropriate; improve logging and monitoring.

Legal, Safety & Operational Notes

Always obtain written authorization and follow the agreed scoping and timing.

Prefer non-intrusive checks on production systems; use test/staging where possible.

Protect sensitive findings — treat outputs as confidential.

Coordinate with ops teams to avoid accidental downtime.
