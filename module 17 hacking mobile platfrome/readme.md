Module 17 – Hacking Mobile Platforms
📌 Overview

Mobile platforms such as Android and iOS are widely used, making them prime targets for attackers. This module explains common mobile threats, vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and security best practices. The focus is on understanding risks and strengthening mobile security.

🎯 Learning Objectives

Understand mobile operating system architectures

Identify common mobile threats

Learn mobile application security concepts

Explore mobile device management & security controls

Understand secure coding practices for mobile apps

Learn mitigation strategies for mobile attacks

📱 Mobile Operating Systems
1. Android

Open-source Linux-based OS

APK file structure

Uses sandboxing and permissions

2. iOS

Closed ecosystem

Strong code-signing and app vetting

Secure Enclave & hardware-based security features

🔍 Common Mobile Threats

Malicious applications (malware, spyware, trojans)

App repackaging & cloning

Rooting/Jailbreaking leading to weakened security

Insecure data storage

Network-based attacks (Wi-Fi sniffing, MITM)

Permission abuse by applications

Phishing & social engineering attacks

🛠 Mobile Attack Vectors (High-level)

Exploiting OS or application vulnerabilities

Installing malicious apps via unofficial stores

Exploiting weak authentication mechanisms

Bypassing application-level protections (rooted/jailbroken devices)

Intercepting network traffic on unsecured Wi-Fi

Abusing insecure APIs and back-end services

⚠️ Note: This module focuses on awareness and defensive understanding, not exploitation.

🔐 Security Controls & Defenses
Device-Level Security

Strong device encryption

Secure boot mechanisms

Biometric authentication

Disable unknown sources (Android)

Application-Level Security

Code obfuscation

Secure API communication (HTTPS/TLS)

Input validation & secure coding practices

Storing sensitive data securely (Keychain/Keystore)

Network Security

Using VPNs

Avoiding public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks

Certificate pinning

Enterprise Mobile Security

Mobile Device Management (MDM)

Mobile Application Management (MAM)

Enforcing security policies (passwords, patching, remote wipe)

📂 Mobile Application Security Testing Concepts

Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

Reverse engineering risks

Identifying insecure permissions

API and backend vulnerability analysis

🛡 Best Practices for Securing Mobile Platforms

Keep OS and apps updated

Install apps only from trusted stores

Review and limit app permissions

Use multi-factor authentication

Encrypt sensitive data

Regular security audits and penetration testing

Use mobile threat defense (MTD) solutions

📝 Conclusion

Mobile devices are powerful yet vulnerable due to open ecosystems, third-party apps, and continuous connectivity. Understanding mobile threats, platform architecture, and secure practices is essential for protecting mobile users and enterprise environments.
